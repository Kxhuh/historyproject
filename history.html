                <p class="text">While several attempts have been made to resolve this dispute, no final resolution has been reached. Such things as illegal settlements, logging, hunting, fishing, threat to human life and many more. 
                    These two governments are now attempting to formalize the deal before the International Court of Justice. 
                    This study presents the subject with an overview of the history of Belize's territorial claim, including the 1931 exchange notes and the roots of the claim, followed by a discussion of the consequences for conservation and efforts to a solution.<br><br>
                    The following reads: We, the Commissioners appointed by the Governments of Guatemala and British Honduras to establish the permanent boundary marks at Garbutt's Falls, Belize River and at Gracias a Dios Falls, Sarstoon River, met at Fallavon, Belize River, on the seventh day of May, 1929. 
                    On the eighth we proceeded to demolish the pile of stones erected at Garbutt's Falls by the Commissioners of 1861, and to erect in its place a concrete monument bearing on its top two copper plates marked "Guatemala" and "British Honduras" respectively. We completed this work on the tenth. 
                    From the eleventh to the fifteenth we were engaged upon other work for our respective Governments, and on the sixteenth we left for Belize, where we arrived on the night of the twentieth. Having made necessary preparations, we left Belize for Sarstoon River on the twenty fourth and arrived at Gracias a Dios Falls on the twenty sixth. 
                    There we erected a monument similar to that of Garbutt's Falls, which we finished on the twenty ninth. We then proceeded down the river to Sarstoon Bar, where we separated.

                The Belize-Guatemala dispute is a problem that affects us up to this day.<br> 
                Although it's a well-known problem, a lot of misinformation is still going around.<br>
                 I chose to represent this topic because I enjoy making websites.<br>
                  I feel this would be an easier and more understandable way to represent the information we have available.<br>
                   As Benjamin Franklin once said, "Being ignorant is not so much a shame as being unwilling to learn."
